# 🌍 Neural Machine Translation: English to French

This repository contains a complete implementation of an NLP project focused on **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** from **English to French** using deep learning techniques. The project leverages state-of-the-art transformer models to perform high-quality sentence-level translation.

## 📁 File Structure

- `NLP_Final_Version_Eng_To_French.ipynb`:  
  A Colab-ready Jupyter Notebook containing the entire training and inference pipeline—from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Tokenization and preprocessing using modern NLP tools  
- ✅ Sequence-to-sequence architecture with attention mechanisms  
- ✅ English to French sentence-level translation  
- ✅ Evaluation with BLEU score  
- ✅ Clean, modular, and beginner-friendly explanations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on notebook)  
- HuggingFace Transformers  
- NLTK / SpaCy  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Google Colab

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NLP-based-Projects.git
   ```

2. Open the notebook:
   - Run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for best compatibility.

3. Modify or input your own English sentences in the inference section to get French translations.
